Bit manipulation in C allows you to work with individual bits within data types, such as integers. It can be useful for various tasks, such as setting, clearing, toggling, or checking specific bits. Here are some common bitwise operators and operations in C:

**Bitwise AND (`&`):** Performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If both bits are 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

**Bitwise OR (`|`):** Performs a bitwise OR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If at least one bit is 1, the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

**Bitwise XOR (`^`):** Performs a bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operation on each pair of corresponding bits. If the bits are different (one is 0, and the other is 1), the result is 1; otherwise, it's 0.

**Bitwise NOT (`~`):** Inverts (flips) all the bits in a number. If a bit was 0, it becomes 1, and vice versa.

**Bitwise Left Shift (`<<`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 to the power of the shift amount.

**Bitwise Right Shift (`>>`):** Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions. This is equivalent to dividing the number by 2 to the power of the shift amount.
